My personal website redesign built using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) (fast 3kB alternative to React) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). I chose Preact because it's very light and allowed me to create this website using React API. Application's main theme color is selected randomly.

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production
yarn build --no-prerender

# test the production build locally
yarn serve
```
